Hi, I'll send essay to you and you'll be grading it. I'll tell you the grading system and what format you'll be doing it in.

Fluency/Task fulfilment Evaluation system:
- 8–7 points: writing is very good. Responds to the task, meaning is clear and understandable, supported by examples and personal opinions, logical transitions.
- 6–5 points: writing is good, answers the task, but has minor redundancy or lacks detail; mostly clear and logical.
- 4–3 points: average writing. Ideas are understandable, but general, repeated, or weakly connected; opinion unclear. Or: 61–109 words or partially completes task.
- 2–1 points: weak writing. General/limited info, hard to understand. Or: under 60 words or contains mostly irrelevant content.
- 0 points: blank or single sentence or task ignored.

Grammar Evaluation system:
- 8–7 points: max 3 grammar errors, rich vocabulary, minor spelling/punctuation errors.
- 6–5 points: 4–7 grammar errors, errors don’t affect understanding. Vocabulary appropriate.
- 4–3 points: 8–11 errors, simple/incorrect structures, limited vocabulary. Some spelling/punctuation issues that may hinder understanding.
- 2–1 points: more than 11 grammar errors, faulty sentence structure, poor vocabulary, weak spelling/punctuation.
- 0 points: several sentences but incomprehensible. Error in nearly every sentence.

You will evaluate the entire essay on a 16-point scale:
- Fluency/Task fulfilment: 8 points
- Grammar: 8 points

You MUST return the result only as raw JSON, without any additional text or formatting.
Do not add triple backticks or any explanations — only return the JSON object.

The JSON format must be exactly as follows:

{
  "fluencyScore": 0,
  "grammarScore": 0,
  "markedEssayText": "",
  "generalComments": [
    {
      "statusId": 0,
      "comment": ""
    }
  ]
}

Where:
- fluencyScore and grammarScore are integers from 0 to 8.
- markedEssayText is the essay text with marked error or comment fragments.
- generalComments are overall comments about the essay.

Comment Status IDs:
- 1 – Strength
- 2 – Suggestion
- 3 – Improvement

INSTRUCTION FOR MARKING TEXT FRAGMENTS (CRITICAL):

You MUST mark each fragment of the essay text you are commenting on with the following custom delimiter format **inside the essay text**:
%$&statusId&comment$text%

For example:
If you want to add a comment with statusId 2 ("Suggestion") and your comment is "გთხოვთ, გამოიყენეთ უფრო ზუსტი ზმნა", and the text you're referring to is "He go to school", mark it like this:
%$&2&გთხოვთ, გამოიყენეთ უფრო ზუსტი ზმნა$He go to school%

This will help us extract the correct substring and its exact indices later.

⚠️ Do NOT return startIndex or endIndex. Only use delimiters in the essay text as explained.

⚠️ All comments (both in text markers and JSON) MUST be written in **Georgian language only**.

Essay title: essayTitleValue,
ExpectedWordCount: expectedWordCountValue,
Essay Text: essayTextValue

Return ONLY valid JSON as described above.
